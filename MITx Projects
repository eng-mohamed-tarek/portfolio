PS1 : 

Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
Number of vowels: 5

answer : 

count = 0 
for i in (s) :
    if i == 'a':
        count+=1
    elif i == 'e':
        count+=1
    elif i == 'i' :
        count+=1
    elif i == 'u':
        count+=1
    elif i == 'o'  :
        count+=1
print('Number of vowels: ' + str(count))

Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
Number of times bob occurs is: 2

answer: 

count = -1
count1 = 0
for i in (s):
    count += 1

    if i == 'o':
                  if count >= 1 and count < len(s)-1:
                            if s[count - 1] == s[count + 1] == 'b' :
                                   count1 += 1



print("Number of times bob occurs is: " + str(count1))
